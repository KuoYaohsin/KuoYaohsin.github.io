    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s complicated to tell why people would create an unreasonable crush to another.When I was at a very young age I have already realized that ,about a kind of astray mood.People all experienced this with no glad end as I did before.But this time ,I may have saw an angel with a halo right now,I told myself like this when I saw her at the first time after Friday’s course beside the backdoor of an ordinary building.Then a crush feeling mingled with fearing came to me.What I feared is based on a selfish concern that if she is single or just broke up with a guy.But I realized that a man should never disturb a girl’s happiness if she is in a full felicity.Cease the waiting, and explore what arises, feel it completely, and let it go.May I talk to you? If you nod and smile at me.</p><p>……To follow a person is to follow a lifestyle.I’ve learnt so much from a good girl’s distinct perspective and cool lifestyle for being a swag girl.( That whether or not she got a boyfriend is another story. )To fail is to let something go,maybe a kind of literally unreasonable mood or a crush.I remember what Steward-Man told Bruce Wayne when I first saw the movie Dark Knight Rises,I’m afraid you want to fail,which is too hard to understand for years.But theses days I’ve learnt a lot as I said above.It is like turning the light on in a darkened room, and the illumination is a sudden enlightenment.She is the illumination indeed.But I’m afraid that any crush would fade at the end like what happened a couple times long time ago and the point is that I can’t figure out whether it is my will or just a natural phenomenon like sun rises and sun sets.I’m afraid I want to fail and to fail is to escape from reality not only let go.</p><p>Whatever, too hard?I am willing to have a try and I will do the best to live each day worthy of myself. And I can wait.Wait for the time, the right chance.</p><a id="more"></a>]]></content>
