<p>杰恩斯认为，处于二分心智状态下的人类，对自己的做的事情与当下的行为，并没有一个思考的过程，他的所作所为是 “ 非意识 “ 的，大部分都是出于本能。比如正在看这篇文章的你可能正在走路，可能摸了一下脸，可能皱了一下眉头，但是你本身并没有思考这个行为的原因和动机。</p>
<p>那么意识是什么呢？杰恩斯认为意识其实是对于思考这个事情本身的感知，是一种对思考的思考。举个例子，《Fami 通》的评分不能信，就是一个基于对《Fami 通》和评分两件东西的理解，然后用过去的经验和记忆形成的综合判断，这是思考，这是有意识。</p>
<p>但就像刚刚提到了，我们对一些本能的行为同样是没法解释的。比如，你刚刚摸了一下脸，但你并不明白这个动作背后的真正动机。但是当我们 “ 意识 “ 到这个行为之后，就能够为它讲述一个故事进行解释。这种能力杰恩斯被称为 “ 叙事（Narratization）”，是具有意识的重要标志之一。</p>
<p>按照杰恩斯的理论来看，在 3000 年之前的人类都处于 “ 无意识 “ 的状态，大多数行为都是由动物本能驱动的，其他的行为则由脑中的声音去命令，而他们则把这个声音称为 “ 神 “。这一点在各种古代文学作品中都有非常多的表现。比如 “ 神告诉 XXXXX”、” 我被恶魔诱惑了 “ 类似等等。杰恩斯认为这些作品其实描述的就是当时的真实情况，并没有艺术加工。</p></div><a href="/2020/05/04/Westworld-Season-3-Finale/" class="read-more">...阅读全文</a></article></li><li class="post-list-item"><article class="post-block"><h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2020/05/04/SharX-a-super-screenshot-tool/" class="post-title-link">SharX, a super screenshot tool.</a></h2><div class="tags"><a href="/tags/Tool/" class="tag-title">#Tool</a></div><div class="post-info">2020年5月4日</div><div class="post-content"><p>Screen capture, file sharing and productivity tool.<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7u86JIx.png"></p></div><a href="/2020/05/04/SharX-a-super-screenshot-tool/" class="read-more">...阅读全文</a></article></li><li class="post-list-item"><article class="post-block"><h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2020/05/04/For-testing-inserting-an-image/" class="post-title-link">For testing inserting a picture.

Over a handful of games with the New York Knicks he went from being an unknown player struggling to escape the NBA’s D-League to an unstoppable basketball force. Now, at age 30, Lin remains a free agent and is struggling with the difficult knowledge that he’s closer to the end of his career than the beginning.</p>
<img src="https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/001/617/703/139782752_crop_north.jpg?h=533&w=800&q=70&crop_x=center&crop_y=top">

<p>“Rock bottom just seems to keep getting more and more rock bottom for me,” Lin said recently during an apperance in Taiwan, “so, free agency has been tough. Because I feel like in some ways the NBA’s kind of given up on me.”</p>
<p>It feels surprising for a player who just won a championship with the Toronto Raptors to make such an admission until you look at the context. Lin was a bit player in Toronto and hasn’t been a regular starter for years. It’s understandable that he doesn’t feel like he “really earned” his championship ring given his limited playing time. It’s also likely that these words are coming from someone whose entire career will be forever overshadowed by a handful of weeks where he was untouchable and unstoppable on the court.</p>
<p>That story – which was labeled “Linsanity” by a pun-crazed press – started on a couch. Claimed by the Knicks in late 2011 after a short stint with the Golden State Warriors, Lin spent some time with the team’s D-League affiliation before being plugged into the lineup after injuries struck other players. Having no idea how long his time in New York would last, Lin ended up staying in his brother’s apartment in the meantime. Slotted into the starting rotation due to the team’s lack of options, Lin’s out-of-nowhere production sparked something with the Knicks, who suddenly went on an improbable winning streak.</p>
<p>The numbers were ridiculous. The Knicks went 7-0 in Lin’s first seven starts at point guard. He scored 136 total points in his first five games at the point for New York, a sequence of victories highlighted by a game-winning three-pointer over the Raptors. The perpetually embattled Knicks had found something unexpected in Lin and they ended up going 9-3 with Lin as a starter heading into the All-Star break in 2012. It would have been a major sports story anywhere, but the fact that it was happening in New York didn’t hurt.</p>
<p>For a brief spell, Lin was a phenomenon. He made the cover of Sports Illustrated two weeks in a row. His underdog story made him a worldwide sensation, with both China and Taiwan competing to claim the newly minted celebrity. Only the fourth Asian-American player in NBA history, his success was rightfully seen as inspirational and the fact that he was a Harvard graduate even helped raise the profile of Ivy League schools as potential basketball hotbeds (not that anybody should feel too sorry about Harvard being overlooked for any reason).</p>
<p>While he had to know that Linsanity was never going to last forever, Lin probably had aspirations that he could at least establish himself as a star player in the league. That never happened. Lin’s 2011-12 season ended in a knee injury and the Knicks were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs without him. The Knicks opted to let him leave for the Houston Rockets, who offered him more money, and Lin has now played for eight NBA teams. He has never made an All-Star team, making him the very definition of a journeyman. By the time he landed in Toronto, it was clear that he was no longer a full-time player.</p>
<p>It might feel like Lin’s career has been a failure, but that’s only if you look at it in the context of Linsanity being some sort of repeatable feat rather than an event that was noteworthy because it was so inexplicable. Lin was never going to be an all-time great. All-time great players don’t tend to go undrafted and aren’t thrown into starting roles by teams acting out of sheer desperation. What Lin ended up being was a very good player who has managed to stay in the league for nine seasons despite being completely overlooked at the start of his career. Along the way he has earned $65m on the court, become a role model around the world and, oh yeah, is the first Asian-American player to win an NBA championship. His story remains one of the most remarkable ones in basketball history and not just as a one-season wonder.</p>
<p>Now, you can’t blame Lin for not quite seeing it that way. Sports remain cruel in one respect: players find themselves looking at the end of their careers at ages when most people have barely started theirs. As NBA writer Nate Jones notes, “within the bubble of the NBA fraternity, feeling like your NBA career could be over is devastating if you actually love hoop.” Basketball mortality is a painful thing even for those rare greats who leave on their own terms. And Lin won’t be leaving the NBA on his own terms.</p>
<p>Then again, it’s not quite over yet. If he wants it, Lin will probably get a shot to latch onto another NBA team, although it will be as a veteran player coming off the bench. It wouldn’t be the most glamorous end to a career but, well, that’s also par for the course in this business. One thing’s for certain, he won’t experience anything like Linsanity ever again, but that’s only because nobody else really has either.</p></div><a href="/2020/05/04/For-testing-inserting-an-image/" class="read-more">...阅读全文</a></article></li><li class="post-list-item"><article class="post-block"><h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2020/05/04/For-testing-inserting-a-video/" class="post-title-link">广陵派名家林友仁演奏古琴名曲《流水》</a></h2><div class="tags"><a href="/tags/TEST/" class="tag-title">#TEST</a></div><div class="post-info">2020年5月4日</div><div class="post-content"><p>&emsp;&emsp;首段，起全曲水流之势，隐约暗示全曲的主题音调。二、三段用泛音写出山涧小溪潺潺、瀑布飞溅的各种泉声。四、五段表现万壑之泉由细流出山汇入洪流，并渐有汹涌之势。自六段起，水流汇入浩瀚汪洋，急流穿峡过滩，形成惊涛骇浪、奔腾难挡的气势，传达了不畏艰险、勇往直前的品格。七、八段为高潮之后的余波，忽缓忽急，时放时收，渐渐平复。第九段以杳渺徐逝的气象终曲。 这首琴曲充满着人与自然的和谐之音，散发了天籁、地籁、人籁相知相合、浑然一体的气象。此曲兼有抒情性和模拟性，虚实结合、情景相融、气象高远。</p>

If you nod and smile at me.</p>
<p>……To follow a person is to follow a lifestyle.I’ve learnt so much from a good girl’s distinct perspective and cool lifestyle for being a swag girl.( That whether or not she got a boyfriend is another story. )To fail is to let something go,maybe a kind of literally unreasonable mood or a crush.I remember what Steward-Man told Bruce Wayne when I first saw the movie Dark Knight Rises,I’m afraid you want to fail,which is too hard to understand for years.But theses days I’ve learnt a lot as I said above.It is like turning the light on in a darkened room, and the illumination is a sudden enlightenment.She is the illumination indeed.But I’m afraid that any crush would fade at the end like what happened a couple times long time ago and the point is that I can’t figure out whether it is my will or just a natural phenomenon like sun rises and sun sets.I’m afraid I want to fail and to fail is to escape from reality not only let go.</p>
<p>Whatever, too hard?I am willing to have a try and I will do the best to live each day worthy of myself. And I can wait.Wait for the time, the right chance.</p></div><a href="/2020/05/03/Tell-me-more/" class="read-more">...阅读全文</a></article></li><li class="post-list-item"><article class="post-block"><h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2020/05/03/hello-world/" class="post-title-link">Hello World</a></h2><div class="tags"></div><div class="post-info">2020年5月3日</div><div class="post-content"></div><a href="/2020/05/03/hello-world/" class="read-more">...阅读全文</a></article></li></ul></main><footer><div class="paginator"><span class="page-number current">1</span></div><div class="copyright"><p>© 2020 Powered by <a href="http://github.com/mediumlobster" tParget="_blank">mediumLobster</a> with ♥.</p></div></footer></div><script src="//cdn.bootcss.com/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML" integrity="sha384-crwIf/BuaWM9rM65iM+dWFldgQ1Un8jWZMuh3puxb8TOY9+linwLoI7ZHZT+aekW" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/9.13.1/highlight.min.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="//cdn.bootcss.com/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script>$(document).ready(function() { hljs.configure({useBR: true}); $('pre').each(function(i, block) { hljs.highlightBlock(block); }); });</script></body></html>
