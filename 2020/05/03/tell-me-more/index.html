If you nod and smile at me.</p>
<p>……To follow a person is to follow a lifestyle.I’ve learnt so much from a good girl’s distinct perspective and cool lifestyle for being a swag girl.( That whether or not she got a boyfriend is another story. )To fail is to let something go,maybe a kind of literally unreasonable mood or a crush.I remember what Steward-Man told Bruce Wayne when I first saw the movie Dark Knight Rises,I’m afraid you want to fail,which is too hard to understand for years.But theses days I’ve learnt a lot as I said above.It is like turning the light on in a darkened room, and the illumination is a sudden enlightenment.She is the illumination indeed.But I’m afraid that any crush would fade at the end like what happened a couple times long time ago and the point is that I can’t figure out whether it is my will or just a natural phenomenon like sun rises and sun sets.I’m afraid I want to fail and to fail is to escape from reality not only let go.</p>
<p>Whatever, too hard?I am willing to have a try and I will do the best to live each day worthy of myself. And I can wait.Wait for the time, the right chance.</p>
